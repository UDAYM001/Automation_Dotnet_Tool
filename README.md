# AutoFlow PDF – PDF Automation Tool

## 📌 Overview
AutoFlow PDF is a Windows Forms application built in C# for automating repetitive PDF-related workflows.  
It allows you to record **action points** (clicks, text inputs, scrolling, hotkeys, file dialogs, etc.) and replay them across multiple PDF files.
